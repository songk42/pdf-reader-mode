Manage your dormspam!

## Parts

### sendit
Handles the logistics of sending a dormspam, so that you the sender do not have to worry about any of it.

Dormspams are organized as described [here](https://how-to-dormspam.mit.edu) (requires a MIT certificate to view; google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qsdxy7ITnDTdYomneYeLzwKsBp-BguTrMANEoGY5rgg/edit)).

### findit
Browse all dormspams sent since the beginning of fall 2021 by content, date sent, type (course, club, job, etc.), and/or bc-talk color.
